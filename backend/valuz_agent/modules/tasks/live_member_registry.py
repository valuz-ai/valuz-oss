"""LiveMemberRegistry — in-memory tracking of a task's live member sessions.

Owns the two shared-state dicts that used to live on ``TaskOrchestrator``:

  * ``_members``: task_id → set of live member session ids, so ``finish_task``
    can broadcast shutdown to every still-running member.
  * ``_dispatch_started``: session_id → dispatch-start epoch. Under the shared
    project cwd, manifest artifacts are attributed by mtime ≥ this timestamp
    (the member's own writes during its run), since there is no private run dir
    to scan.

Invariant — all methods are PLAIN SYNCHRONOUS (never ``async``). This is
load-bearing: members are spawned via ``asyncio.create_task`` and must be
tracked with no ``await`` gap between spawn and registration. An ``await``
point between the two would let a concurrently-running ``finish_task`` /
``_broadcast_shutdown`` observe the registry mid-mutation and drop a
just-spawned member. For the same reason ``drain_members`` snapshots AND clears
in a single ``pop`` — splitting it into a read followed by a separate clear
would reopen that race.
