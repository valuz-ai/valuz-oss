"""Shared Pydantic schemas for the sessions domain.

The ``SessionModelSelection`` mixin lives here so every entry point
that creates a kernel session — interactive chat, project chat, the
Skill Creator launcher, and any future programmatic creator — accepts
the same nullable ``model_id`` / ``provider_id`` shape and feeds it
through the shared ``adapters.model_resolver.resolve_model`` precedence:

    explicit model_id → channel.default_model →
    project default (forthcoming) → global fallback.

Keeping the input contract in one place stops drift like
``POST /v1/skills/create/chat/start`` quietly hard-coding the channel
default while ``POST /v1/sessions`` exposed the model knob.
