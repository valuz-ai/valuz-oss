Python/FastAPI on an Agent Harness kernel. The **host**
(`valuz_agent/`) owns the project UX, agent library, skill catalog, KB,
providers, MCP catalog, scheduling, tasks, and OAuth; the **kernel**
(`kernel/`) owns Session/Message/Event persistence (each session embeds its
AgentConfig snapshot and cwd — the kernel knows no projects or agents) and
the runtime adapters. The two meet only at the adapter seam (§6).

```

A single SQLite file at `~/.valuz/app/valuz.db` carries both layers:
3 unprefixed kernel tables (`sessions` / `messages` / `events`),
the `valuz_*`-prefixed business tables, and two alembic heads
(`alembic_version` kernel + `alembic_version_host` host). Both layers run
**async** SQLAlchemy on aiosqlite; WAL + per-connection `busy_timeout` make
concurrent access safe.

## The two boundary contracts

These are the backend's load-bearing rules. Both are mechanically enforced.

**Module boundary** — a module under `modules/<Y>/` must **not** import a
sibling's persistence layer (`modules.<X>.datastore`, X≠Y). Cross-module
collaboration goes through the sibling's **service** API or a `ports/`
protocol. Enforced by `scripts/check_module_boundaries.py` (wired into
`make lint`).

**Kernel boundary** — every host *operation* on kernel state goes through
`adapters/kernel_client.py` (the `KernelClient` protocol: API-shaped, typed
with the kernel's wire schemas from `app.schemas`). Two transports implement
it: `InProcessKernelClient` (default) and `HttpKernelClient`
(`adapters/kernel_client_http.py`) for a kernel running as a separate
process — selected by `VALUZ_KERNEL_MODE=inprocess|http`
(+ `VALUZ_KERNEL_URL` / `VALUZ_KERNEL_TOKEN`); `VALUZ_KERNEL_DATABASE_URL`
gives the kernel its own database file. Env contract for the split: the
kernel *server* process reads `KERNEL_AUTH_TOKEN` (and refuses to start
standalone without it unless `KERNEL_ALLOW_UNAUTHENTICATED=1`); the host
*client* sends `VALUZ_KERNEL_TOKEN` — the provisioner sets both to the
same secret. Import rules, all mechanically
enforced by `scripts/check_module_boundaries.py`:
`src.adapters` / `src.runtimes` (and their `kernel.`-prefixed spellings)
are forbidden everywhere; `app.dependencies` / `app.routes` /
`app.event_stream` are restricted to the seam + `boot/kernel.py`;
`src.core` domain types are restricted to the documented exemption files
(`SRC_CORE_ALLOWLIST` — AgentConfig builders + tool registration).
Event reads/subscriptions, usage aggregates and the run-drivers all go
through the client (the former `broadcast_sink` / raw-SQL SSE adapter /
analytics-ORM bypasses are retired). The former in-process
tool-handler registration is retired too: the harness tools (dispatch /
orchestration / memory / submit_skill) are served by the host's toolkit
MCP server (`integrations/toolkit_mcp_server.py`, mounted at
`/internal/mcp/toolkit/{base,lead}`) and referenced from
`session.mcp_servers` as the `harness` entry — every runtime consumes
them through its standard MCP client path, in-process and remote alike.

## Anatomy of a business module

`modules/<x>/` is a flat package with a conventional split (not every module
has every file):

| File | Responsibility |
|------|----------------|
| `models.py` | ORM / domain models (`valuz_*` tables) |
| `datastore.py` | persistence only — the only layer that touches the DB session |
| `service.py` | business logic; orchestrates datastore + ports; raises typed errors |
| `errors.py` | module exceptions (see §Errors) |
| `schemas.py` / `dto.py` | Pydantic request/response + internal DTOs |
| `mappers.py` | model ↔ schema/DTO conversion |

HTTP entry points do **not** live here — they live in `api/routes/<x>.py`. A
module never imports FastAPI.

Datastore naming convention: `get_by_id() -> Optional[Model]`,
`list_by_*() -> list[Model]`, `count_by_*() -> int`, `exists_*() -> bool`,
`create_*` / `update_*` / `bulk_*`. Datastore propagates DB exceptions upward;
the service converts them into business errors.

## API layer & request flow

```
api/routes/<x>.py  →  modules/<x>/service.py  →  modules/<x>/datastore.py
   (HTTP, deps)          (business logic)            (DB session)
```

- A route file declares `router = APIRouter(prefix="/v1/<x>", tags=["<x>"])`
  and is wired in `api/app.py` via `app.include_router(...)`.
- Services and the current user arrive by dependency injection from
  `api/deps.py` (`get_current_user`, `get_<x>_service`, …).
- Routes open DB work with `async_unit_of_work()` from `infra/db.py`; they
  return Pydantic models directly (FastAPI serializes) and raise
  `HTTPException` or module errors — never hand-roll envelope dicts.
- The contract in `api/openapi.yaml` is the source of truth; routes implement
  it, and frontend types regenerate from it.

## Errors

Module errors subclass the shared bases in `infra/errors` — all rooted at
`ValuzError` (`BadRequestError`, `NotFoundError`, `ConflictError`,
`UnprocessableEntityError`, `ForbiddenError`, `GoneError`, …) — and carry a
stable `error_code` + default `message`:

```python
from valuz_agent.infra.errors import NotFoundError

class ProviderNotFound(NotFoundError):
    error_code = 404_201          # HTTP(3) + module(2) + sequence(2)
    message = "Model provider not found"
```

Raise typed errors in the service layer; the API layer maps them to responses.
Keep HTTP concerns out of `service.py` / `datastore.py`.

## Database & migrations

All host DB access goes through `infra/db.py` — never construct a session
elsewhere:

- `async with async_unit_of_work(commit=True) as session:` — the default unit
  of work (commits on success, rolls back on error).
- `get_async_session()` — a FastAPI dependency yielding a session.
- `async_commit_with_retry(...)` — for write contention under WAL.

**Never run a synchronous DB call on the event loop.** The host was migrated
off its sync engine specifically to kill an event-loop deadlock; sync-on-loop
reintroduces it.

Both alembic chains live under `backend/alembic/`: `host/` (version table
`alembic_version_host`) and `kernel/` (`alembic_version`). They share the one
SQLite file but never collide. Both run at boot via `boot/`. Run alembic from
`backend/` (e.g. `uv run alembic -c alembic/host/alembic.ini upgrade head`).
Every migration must be **reversible** — always implement `downgrade()`.
Autogenerate against the async engine, then review the diff (SQLite has limited
`ALTER`; batch ops are often required).

## The adapter seam

`valuz_agent/adapters/*` is the only place the host and kernel meet. Each
adapter turns a stored host definition into something the kernel consumes at
session-creation time:

| Adapter | Job |
|---------|-----|
| `kernel_client` | `KernelClient` protocol + in-process impl — API-shaped seam, wire-schema typed (swap for HTTP in remote mode) |
| `capability_resolver` | project + extras → kernel skills / MCP set |
| `model_resolver` | request + provider + default → concrete model id |
| `mcp_resolver` | slug + creds → `list[McpServerConfig]` |
| `event_sse_adapter` | kernel `events` table → SSE frames |
| `system_prompt_builder` | agent instructions + project context → system prompt |

If you need kernel behavior, add it behind an adapter — do not import kernel
internals from `api/`, `modules/`, or `integrations/`.

## Ports & integrations (OSS vs overlay)

`ports/` holds the cross-cutting **protocols** the host depends on —
`identity` (AuthProvider/UserIdentity), `docs_runtime`, `parser_backend`,
`tool_provider`, `llm_provider`, `mcp_catalog`, `provider_policy`, `billing`,
`skill_registry`, `resource_*`. `integrations/` holds the concrete
implementations bound at composition time (`auth_reportify`, `mcp_reportify`,
`docs_embedded`, `parser_light_local`, `tools_core`, …).

This seam is also where editions diverge: the OSS build binds permissive
defaults (e.g. `provider_policy` permits every write), and a commercial overlay
can bind stricter implementations of the same ports without touching module
code. Add a capability by defining a port, then a default integration.

## Config, secrets, filesystem

- `infra/config.py` owns all paths (the `~/.valuz` tree) and settings. It is
  the only place allowed to compute `Path.home()`-relative locations.
- `infra/secret_store` keeps API keys / OAuth tokens in the OS keychain — never
  plaintext on disk.
- `infra/fs_registry.FsRegistry` is the single gate for host filesystem writes.
  Hardcoded `~/.claude/...` or ad-hoc `Path.home()` outside `config.py` and the
  registry are forbidden. The kernel manages its own subtree under each
  `project.cwd`; get the cwd from `project_cwd(...)` and let the kernel take
  it from there.

## Adding an endpoint (contract-first recipe)

1. Edit `api/openapi.yaml` (the contract leads).
2. Add/extend `api/routes/<x>.py`; include its router in `api/app.py`.
3. Implement logic in `modules/<x>/service.py` (+ `datastore.py`, `errors.py`,
   `schemas.py` as needed). Respect both boundary contracts.
4. If kernel data is involved, go through an `adapters/*` resolver.
5. Add tests under `tests/`; run `make generate-types` for the frontend.

## Commands

```bash
cd backend
uv sync                          # create .venv, install deps
uv sync --extra dev              # + pytest, mypy, ruff

uv run python -m valuz_agent --port 8000 --reload   # what dev.sh spawns
uv run python -m valuz_agent.cli serve --port 8000  # Typer CLI
uv run python -m valuz_agent.cli reset-providers

uv run pytest                    # all tests        (or: tests/<path>)
uv run mypy valuz_agent/         # type check
uv run ruff check valuz_agent/   # lint   (ruff format to format)
uv run alembic -c alembic/host/alembic.ini revision --autogenerate -m "<msg>"
```

Prefer `./scripts/dev.sh` (backend on :8000 + desktop) for day-to-day work;
logs land under `.ai/dev/{backend,frontend}.log`.

## Gotchas

- **Python 3.12–3.13 only** (`requires-python >=3.12,<3.14`); `uv sync`
  resolves 3.13. Don't use system Python — parser deps (`markitdown`,
  `pymupdf4llm`) lack 3.14 wheels.
- **Port 8000 is load-bearing** — it matches the frontend's default
  `VITE_API_BASE_URL`. Change it on both sides or not at all.
- **ruff**: line-length 100, target `py312`. **mypy**: the kernel is on
  `mypy_path` but `src.*` / `kernel.*` use `follow_imports = "skip"`, so host
  mypy never type-checks kernel internals — keep host code self-contained.
- **`rg`** (ripgrep) is a runtime helper for `integrations/docs_embedded`,
  located via the `VALUZ_RG_PATH` env the Electron sidecar sets to the packaged
  `libexec/rg`. The binary is vendored per platform at
  `backend/vendor/rg/<platform-tag>-<arch-tag>/` (refresh with
  `scripts/download-rg.sh`).
